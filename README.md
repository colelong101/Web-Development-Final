# Web-Development-Final

## The Final
This is my Intro to Web Development Final. Over the course of this class, I have learned even more of the basics and fundamentals of the career path I have chosen, and I have loved every minute of it. The instructor gave a clear path to succeed in the class, and did an amazing job giving out extra resources as well.

## The Mission
My mission for the final project was to finally lay down the foundation for my web hosted personal portfolio. I have minimal projects to showcase, but this will be my first substantial one. This webpage contains a short description of me, and mt interests, has a layout for importing my projects to showcase, as well as a form to reach out to me regarding the webpage, or any inquiries.

## What's Next
My next goal is to continue learning. At my internship, I use PHP, Laravel and BootstrapVUE, so I want to educate myself even more in that, along with making personal projects to add to my GitHub.
